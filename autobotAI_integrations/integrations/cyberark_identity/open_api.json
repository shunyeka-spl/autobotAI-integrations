        "description": "CyberArk Identity uses OAuth 2.0 access tokens to authenticate API requests.\nYou acquire access tokens on behalf of CyberArk Identity users by calling `/Security/StartAuthentication`. Clients requiring access to resources outside of a specific user's context should use the [client credentials flow](https://docs.cyberark.com/Idaptive/Latest/en/Content/Developer/oauth/client-cred-flow.htm) instead.\n\nYour request header must contain `X-IDAP-NATIVE-CLIENT:true` to indicate that an application is invoking the CyberArk Identity endpoint, and `Content-Type: application/json` to indicate that the body is in JSON format.\n\nThe request body must include the `TenantID`, `User`, and `API Version` attributes. To identify the user being authenticated, CyberArk Identity needs their `User` identifier and `TenantId`. If the user exists, the server returns the challenge to the client.\n\nIf you call `/Security/StartAuthentication` with a system-generated tenant URL and there is a custom URL defined for the tenant, the call returns the custom tenant URL in `PodFQDN`. Call `/Security/StartAuthentication` again with the custom tenant URL.\n\n## Advance Authentication\n`/Security/StartAuthentication` initiates the user's authentication process. If the user exists, the response contains a `Summary` of either `LoginSuccess` or `NewPackage`.\nYou receive `LoginSuccess` when the request includes an `.ASPXAUTH` cookie from prior successful authentication. Otherwise, `NewPackage` responses contain an authentication package consisting of one or two challenges the user must answer. Each challenge must be completed using an MFA mechanism. Mechanisms can be either in-band or out-of-band (OOB). You collect in-band mechanism responses, such as passwords, directly from the user. Users must interact with out-of-band mechanisms, such as SMS codes, from outside of your app.\nYou should complete authentication by calling [/Security/AdvanceAuthentication](openapi/identity_merged_files/Authentication&Authorization.yaml/paths/~1Security~1AdvanceAuthentication/post) sequentially for each mechanism the user chooses to answer.\n## Federated users\nWhen you specify a `User` associated with a SAML or OIDC-based federation, then the response contains a redirect to the external IdP.\n",

        "description": "Call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication` to complete a single authentication challenge.\nFor most authentication requests, [/Security/StartAuthentication](openapi/identity_merged_files/Authentication&Authorization.yaml/paths/~1Security~1StartAuthentication/post) creates a `NewPackage` consisting of one or two challenges. Packages with two challenges represent multi-factor authentication (MFA).\nYou should iterate through the `Challenges` array in the order in which you receive it. For each challenge, allow the user to choose one of the provided mechanisms.\nSome challenges can only be answered with a single mechanism. In this case, you should automatically choose the mechanism without showing the user a list of options.\nFor each successful request, you receive a response with one of three `Summary` types:\n  * `LoginSuccess`: The user has completed all challenges in the authentication package.\n  * `StartNextChallenge`: The user has completed the previous challenge and should proceed to the next one.\n  * `OobPending`: You have initiated an [out-of-band mechanism](#out-of-band-mechanisms) flow, but the user has not yet completed it.\n## Access tokens\nWhen you receive `LoginSuccess`, the response includes an `.ASPXAUTH` cookie:  \n`.ASPXAUTH=11BA426199A9092FBF36746C5DB361934A9B0E3E6...`\n\nMake sure your app saves this cookie. It contains an opaque access token you need to make API requests on behalf of the authenticated user. This token's scope is limited to the user's configured permissions.\nIf your app is browser-based, the cookie be automatically stored in the user's browser and forwarded with future requests. However, if you're planning to call the CyberArk Identity API from a server, you should explicitly store the access token. You can include the access token in API request headers using the format `Authorization: Bearer 11BA426199A9092FBF...`.\n## In-band mechanisms\nUser passwords and security questions are in-band mechanisms. You directly collect their responses from users in your client. Then, you call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication`, setting `Action` to `Answer` and `Answer` to the user-provided value:\n```json\n{\n  \"Action\": \"Answer\",\n  \"Answer\": \"password1234\",\n  \"TenantId\":\"ABC1234\",\n  \"SessionId\":\"3RrrrhXFcUS3UEvl-3wfgMYojGz44P76Or2Ym3zztyM1\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"64Sn74WQXEaizC7mhZpeucoWNldHkc8z7vWc9XcIJLo1\"\n}\n```\n### User password\nWhen a user chooses the `UP` mechanism, they must enter their password into your client.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\":\"UP\",\n  \"AnswerType\":\"Text\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"Enter Password\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"Password\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"64Sn74WQXEaizC7mhZpeucoWNldHkc8z7vWc9XcIJLo1\"\n}\n```\n### Security question\nWhen a user chooses the `SQ` mechanism, they must answer at least one personal or admin-created security question.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"SQ\",\n  \"AnswerType\": \"Text\",\n  \"MultipartMechanism\": {\n    \"PromptSelectMech\": \"Security Question\",\n    \"MechanismParts\": [{\n      \"Uuid\": \"u_a4ed8e81-8e9b-416b-bc00-44ed5bf87744\",\n      \"QuestionText\": \"What is your cat's name?\",\n      \"PromptMechChosen\": \"Answer security question 'What is your cat's name?':\"\n    }]\n  },\n  \"Question\": \"What is your cat's name?\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\": \"Answer security question 'What is your cat's name?':\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\": \"Security Question\",\n  \"MechanismId\": \"UwGNuG9netHTOLrHFF91nO8zFBli_lVDl-0UF4Og4j01\"\n}\n```\nIf the user only needs to answer a single question, you can reply with their answer directly:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"MechanismId\": \"OdzdNlLsH84bsmBiXabDHnIscu69RUpGpJ5oQrjWmZc1\",\n  \"Answer\": \"Smokey\",\n  \"Action\": \"Answer\"\n}\n```\nDepending on their tenant's [authentication profile](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/Idaptive/Latest/en/Content/CoreServices/Authenticate/AuthProfilesCreate.htm), the user might have to answer multiple questions. When this happens, `MechanismParts` contains one element for every question.\nIn your response, place each answer in a UUID/answer key-value pair object:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"MechanismId\": \"OdzdNlLsH84bsmBiXabDHnIscu69RUpGpJ5oQrjWmZc1\",\n  \"Answer\": {\n    \"u_a4ed8e81-8e9b-416b-bc00-44ed5bf87744\": \"Arnold\",\n    \"u_144b2e18-9276-49ed-b67a-9e28692f4375\": \"Smokey\"\n  },\n  \"Action\": \"Answer\"\n}\n```\n## Out-of-band mechanisms\nSome mechanisms require the user to interact with a system outside of your client. These are known as out-of-band (OOB) mechanisms.\nOnce the user has chosen an OOB mechanism, call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication` with the `Action` set to `StartOOB`. This officially begins the waiting period in which the user must either approve the request or provide a code.\nWhile you wait for the user to take action, perform a \"short poll\" on `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication`. You build the poll request by simply changing the original request's `Action` from `StartOOB` to `Poll`.\nFor example, you would initiate an OOB mechanism using:\n```json\n{\n  \"Action\":\"StartOOB\",\n  \"TenantId\":\"ABC1234\",\n  \"SessionId\":\"3RrrrhXFcUS3UEvl-3wfgMYojGz44P76Or2Ym3zztyM1\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"bFxWVmtoBTV_h4C26UVfMzOGJa94zHxOqoEG_XrjZE81\"\n}\n```\nAfter you receive a `Success` response, you would then immediately begin polling with:\n```json\n{\n  \"Action\":\"Poll\",\n  \"TenantId\":\"ABC1234\",\n  \"SessionId\":\"3RrrrhXFcUS3UEvl-3wfgMYojGz44P76Or2Ym3zztyM1\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"bFxWVmtoBTV_h4C26UVfMzOGJa94zHxOqoEG_XrjZE81\"\n}\n```\nSend this request once every second until the response `Summary` changes from `OobPending` to either `StartNextChallenge` or `LoginSuccess`.\n### Answerability\nMost out-of-band mechanisms provide a one-time passcode (OTP) the user can input into your app. These types of mechanisms are called _answerable_ because you can complete them with an answer instead of waiting for polling.\nWhen a user enters an answerable mechanism's OTP into your app, you should call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication` using the original `MechanismId`. In your request, make sure to also set the `Action` to `Answer` and `Answer` to the user-provided code.\nFor example, if a user enters an OATH OTP into your app, your request should look like:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"Action\":\"Answer\",\n  \"Answer\":\"728133\"\n}\n```\n### Batch operations\nInstead of making separate API calls, you can batch `Answer` and `StartOOB` calls into one HTTP request. This is useful when you want to complete a user's in-band challenge at the same time that you initiate an out-of-band challenge.\nInclude these requests in the `MultipleOperations` top-level request body field, as in the following example:\n```json\n{\n  \"TenantId\":\"ABC1234\",\n  \"SessionId\":\"17Xg9ZtDjk2klVNWgICuJpFH_Tp66-7eRhJMpnCYY-k1\",\n  \"MultipleOperations\":[\n      {\n        \"MechanismId\":\"4TYsdsCI6E2bB1IFU_bww4JmtpC9Pz46DdGo_cFGykI1\",\n        \"Answer\":\"password1234\",\n        \"Action\":\"Answer\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"MechanismId\":\"Mfi55lKZ10eDCjkoezo5IsWSxv4Y3gdfkt0MaDoA9ts1\",\n        \"Action\":\"StartOOB\"\n      }\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Supported OOB mechanisms\nThe following out-of-band mechanisms are supported:\n#### Phone call\n**Answerable:** `❌`  \nWhen a user chooses the `PF` mechanism, they receive a phone call. During the call, they must enter their [PIN](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/Idaptive/Latest/en/Content/UserPortal/SpecPhonePIN.htm) using the phone's keypad.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\":\"PF\",\n  \"AnswerType\":\"StartOob\",\n  \"PartialPhoneNumber\":\"6789\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"We will now attempt to call your phone (6789). Please follow the instructions to proceed with authentication.\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"Phone Call... XXX-6789\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"QqvZbCxYSkyDTEICR-6H6f_mzaxlfotu2wQxnVejsOo1\"\n}\n```\n#### Email\n**Answerable:** `✔️`  \nWhen a user chooses the `EMAIL` mechanism, they receive an email containing both a one-time passcode (OTP) and a link. If the user clicks the link, the challenge advances at your next poll request.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\":\"EMAIL\",\n  \"MaskedEmailAddress\":\"***@cyberark.com\",\n  \"AnswerType\":\"StartTextOob\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"Email sent to xxxx@cyberark.com. Click the link or manually enter the code to authenticate.\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"Email... @cyberark.com\",\n  \"PartialAddress\":\"cyberark.com\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"RPcez9pD9AooKNT5UkEq7kozzer6e0BGn7GGzjDlQqc1\"\n}\n```\n#### SMS\n**Answerable:** `✔️`  \nWhen a user chooses the `SMS` mechanism, they receive an SMS text containing both a one-time passcode (OTP) and a link. If the user clicks the link, the challenge advances at your next poll request.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\":\"SMS\",\n  \"AnswerType\":\"StartTextOob\",\n  \"PartialDeviceAddress\":\"6789\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"Sending a text to mobile phone ending... 6789. Enter the code or click the link in the message to proceed with authentication.\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"SMS... XXX-6789\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"1YhBw3Gg4Z2etR8RBQebQdTcpRCD-UVBv27xTVNmSDM1\"\n}\n```\n#### OATH OTP\n**Answerable:** `✔️`  \nWhen a user chooses the `OATH` mechanism, they must generate an [OATH one-time passcode (OTP)](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/Idaptive/Latest/en/Content/CoreServices/Authenticate/OATHOTPConfig.htm) in either their mobile authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator) or the desktop CyberArk Authenticator app.\nMost users manually enter their OTP into your app. However, users that have configured the CyberArk Identity mobile app as their OTP authenticator can choose to approve the login within that app.\nFor this reason, the OATH OTP mechanism supports `Poll` as a form of advancement.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"OATH\",\n  \"AnswerType\": \"StartTextOob\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\": \"Enter Verification Code\",\n  \"UiPrompt\": \"OATH OTP Client\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\": \"OATH OTP Client\",\n  \"MechanismId\": \"DKetaPxIW0yn8e-jBi7fTUz0H8OdsCNCscUijVXUR6s1\"\n}\n```\n#### Mobile Authenticator\n**Answerable:** `✔️`  \nWhen a user chooses the `OTP` mechanism, they must either generate an OTP or approve a push notification from within the CyberArk Identity mobile app.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\":\"OTP\",\n  \"AnswerType\":\"StartTextOob\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"Sent Mobile Authenticator request to your device. Please follow the instructions to proceed with authentication or enter verification code here.\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"Mobile Authenticator\",\n  \"MechanismId\":\"rKgeXzVIKkKR5ERTUKhT7XuyaYS6LcLhpLkSythzHIA1\"\n}\n```\n#### FIDO2 Security Key\n**Answerable:** `✔️`  \nWhen a user chooses the `U2F` mechanism, they must insert a [FIDO2 security key](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/Idaptive/Latest/en/Content/CoreServices/Authenticate/U2FAuth.htm) into their device.\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"U2F\",\n  \"AnswerType\": \"StartTextOob\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\": \"Insert security key and press its button\",\n  \"UiPrompt\": \"FIDO2 Security Key\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\": \"FIDO2 Security Key\",\n  \"MechanismId\": \"xmbeXzVI8v15ERTUKh7TXuyaY133cLhpLkSythzHIA1\",\n  \"Type\": \"SECURITYKEY\"\n}\n```\nYour client must use a browser or native API such as [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/) to receive a code from the security key. This process occurs solely on the user's device.\nCyberArk Identity cannot observe this process, and for that reason, polling is not supported. To advance `U2F`, you must submit the code as an answer.\n#### QR Code\n**Answerable:** `❌`  \nWhen a user chooses the `QR` mechanism, they must scan a QR code using the QR Code Authenticator feature in the CyberArk Identity mobile app. The QR code your client should display is provided as a base64-encoded image.\nThe challenge advances at your next poll request once the user has scanned the code on their enrolled device.\n```json\n{\n  \"AnswerType\": \"StartOob\",\n  \"Name\": \"QR\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\": \"Scan QR Code with the CyberArk Identity app on an enrolled device.\",\n  \"PromptSelectMech\": \"QR Code\",\n  \"MechanismId\": \"VuaMU...\",\n  \"Image\": \"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...\"\n}\n```\n## Interface text\nSome mechanisms include the `PromptSelectMech` and `PromptMechChosen` descriptions. These provide user-friendly interface text tailored to each mechanism.\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"PromptSelectMech\":\"Email... @cyberark.com\",\n  \"PromptMechChosen\":\"Email sent to xxxx@cyberark.com. Click the link or manually enter the code to authenticate.\"\n}\n```\nUse `PromptSelectMech` as a short description of the mechanism in a list of possible mechanism choices. Use `PromptMechChosen` to provide completion criteria once the user has selected the mechanism.\n## Failures\nThe following scenarios can cause a mechanism to fail:\n* The user provides an invalid value for an in-band or out-of-band mechanism\n* The user denies an OOB confirmation, such as a push notification\n* An OOB mechanism times out due to a lack of user action\nTo mitigate brute force attacks, any of these failures invalidates the authentication package with the following generic message:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"Result\": {\n      \"Summary\": \"Failure\"\n  },\n  \"Message\": \"Authentication (login or challenge) has failed. Please try again or contact your system administrator.\",\n}\n```\nYour client should offer the user the ability to start the authentication process again. However, you must call [/Security/StartAuthentication](openapi/identity_merged_files/Authentication&Authorization.yaml/paths/~1Security~1StartAuthentication/post) to receive a new authentication package.\n",
