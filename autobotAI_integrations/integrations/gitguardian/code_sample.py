    Executes provided Python code within integrations.

    Args:
        context (dict): A dictionary containing information about the current execution.
            - params (dict): A dictionary containing parameters specified while creating action.
            - clients (dict): A dictionary that contain selected client objects while defining action. (The specific clients present and their usage depend on the specific action being executed.)

    Returns:
        list: Always returns an empty list (`[]`) or a list containing the results of the code execution. The specific content of the returned list depends on the code and how it interacts with the integration.
