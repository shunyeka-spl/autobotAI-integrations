def executor(context):
    """
    Executes provided Python code within integrations.

    Args:
        context (dict): A dictionary containing information about the current execution.
            - params (dict): A dictionary containing parameters specified while creating action.
            - clients (dict): A dictionary that contain selected client objects while defining action. (The specific clients present and their usage depend on the specific action being executed.)

    Returns:
        list: Always returns an empty list (`[]`) or a list containing the results of the code execution. The specific content of the returned list depends on the code and how it interacts with the integration.

    params = context["params"]
    clients = context["clients"]

    # Placeholder for retrieving the integration-specific client if needed
    # client = clients["client_name"]  # Uncomment and modify this line to retrieve the client

    # User's Python code execution logic goes here
    # (Replace this comment with the your actual code)

    # Example: Perform you linux operations (for illustration purposes only)
    # You can use libraries like os, subprocess, paramiko, psutil
    # to fetch the details

    # Always return a list
    return []
