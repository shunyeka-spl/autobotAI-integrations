## AutobotAI Integrations Overview

The AutobotAI integrations operate on two primary foundations: the Python SDK and Steampipe. Each integration is designed to leverage these technologies for distinct purposes, ensuring flexibility and functionality across different use cases.

### 1. **Steampipe (No-Code Action)**
Steampipe-based integrations are referred to as **No-Code Actions**. These actions are primarily used for data fetching operations, also known as **Fetcher Actions**. They allow users to retrieve data without needing to write custom code, making it easy to gather and analyze information from various sources.

### 2. **Python SDK (Code Action)**
Python-based integrations are designed for more complex operations such as creating, editing, deleting, or executing other custom actions. These **Code Actions** provide users with the ability to perform mutations on data, offering flexibility for tailored automation and processing.

### Overview of Integration Capabilities

Below is a comprehensive overview of the support for both No-Code and Code Actions across the various integrations:
